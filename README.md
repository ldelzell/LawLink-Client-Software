# LawLink Client Software

## Introduction

Introducing software designed to fit almost any company's infrastructure. It is a client software solution that allows companies to manage both employees and client tasks from a single platform. With an improved UI and UX, we aim to make everything easier by centralizing all operations. This specific software is tailored to the needs of law firms.

As part of the research, I analyzed the challenges faced by law firms by watching the TV series *Suits* and interviewing several of my colleagues from the Law Department at Fontys University. Based on these insights, I created this software to address the issues identified.

## Technologies

Java, Gradle, Spring Boot, JWT Authentication, WebSockets, React, TypeScript, with MySQL as the database implemented using Flyway and JPA.

## 2. Current Situation

The situation is similar across many law firms—chaos! Implementing client software into a company's system can make life easier for everyone—managers, employees, and most importantly, customers. By simplifying the steps to complete tasks that a customer needs, we make the journey much more enjoyable and less frustrating. Law firms, in particular, are extremely busy managing clients and employees, and as a result, many mistakes occur throughout the day.

## 3. Problem Description

The problem revolves around inefficiencies and disorganization within law firms due to high workloads and manual processes. Implementing client software can streamline operations, reduce errors, and simplify tasks for managers, employees, and clients. This will improve customer satisfaction by making processes faster and more efficient while helping law firms manage clients and employees more effectively.

## 4. Project Goal

The project goal is to develop and implement client management software that streamlines operations within law firms, reduces errors, and improves overall efficiency. This software will simplify client interactions, enhance employee management, and create a smoother, more enjoyable experience for customers, ultimately improving service quality and productivity.
